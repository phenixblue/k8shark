# Usage

## Prerequisites

- `kubectl` in your `PATH`
- A valid `~/.kube/config` (or `KUBECONFIG` env set) pointing at a cluster — for `capture` only
- Go 1.22+ if building from source

## Installation

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install phenixblue/tap/k8shark
```

### go install

```sh
go install github.com/phenixblue/k8shark@latest
```

The binary is named `kshrk`.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/phenixblue/k8shark
cd k8shark
make build
# binary written to ./kshrk
```

---

## Capture

Run `kshrk capture` while connected to the cluster. It polls the Kubernetes API at defined intervals and packages all responses into a `.tar.gz` archive.

```sh
kshrk capture --config k8shark.yaml
```

The command shows a spinner while running, then prints a summary:

```
Starting capture -> ./capture.tar.gz
  capturing |
Capture complete
  Output:    ./capture.tar.gz (1.2 MB)
  Records:   480 across 12 resource path(s)
  Duration:  10m0s
```

### Capture flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--config` | | `./k8shark.yaml` | Path to config file |
| `--output` | `-o` | `./k8shark-<timestamp>.tar.gz` | Output archive path |
| `--duration` | | from config | Override capture duration (e.g. `5m`) |
| `--kubeconfig` | | `$KUBECONFIG` / `~/.kube/config` | Source cluster kubeconfig |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | false | Log every API path as it is fetched |

The `--config` flag auto-discovers `./k8shark.yaml` if not specified.

---

## Inspect

`kshrk inspect` reads a capture archive and prints a summary of its contents without starting a server.

```sh
kshrk inspect capture.tar.gz
```

Example output:

```
Capture ID:   a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
Captured:     2026-04-09T08:00:00Z → 2026-04-09T08:10:00Z  (10m0s)
Kubernetes:   v1.29.0
Server:       https://192.168.1.100:6443
Archive:      capture.tar.gz (1245184 bytes)
Records:      480

RESOURCE              GROUP  VERSION  NAMESPACED  NAMESPACES              RECORDS
deployments           apps   v1       yes         default,production      80
nodes                        v1       no          -                       10
pods                         v1       yes         default,kube-system     320
secrets                      v1       yes         default                 40
statefulsets          apps   v1       yes         production              30
```

Use `-o json` or `-o yaml` for machine-readable output:

```sh
kshrk inspect capture.tar.gz -o json
kshrk inspect capture.tar.gz -o yaml
```

### Inspect flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--output` | `-o` | `table` | Output format: `table`, `json`, or `yaml` |

---

## Open

`kshrk open` extracts the archive, starts a local mock HTTPS API server on `127.0.0.1`, and writes a kubeconfig pointing at it.

```sh
kshrk open capture.tar.gz
```

Output:

```
k8shark mock server running
  Address:    https://127.0.0.1:54321
  Kubeconfig: ~/.kube/k8shark-abc123def456.yaml

Run: export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/k8shark-abc123def456.yaml
Then use kubectl normally against the capture.

Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

Set `KUBECONFIG` and use `kubectl` as you would against a live cluster:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/k8shark-abc123def456.yaml

kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get pods -n production -o yaml
kubectl describe deployment my-app -n production
kubectl get pvc -n staging
kubectl top pods -n production   # not supported — only read API calls
```

The server stays running until `Ctrl+C`.

### Open flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--port` | random | Port for the mock API server |
| `--kubeconfig-out` | `~/.kube/k8shark-<id>.yaml` | Where to write the generated kubeconfig |
| `--at` | latest records | Pin replay to a specific timestamp (see below) |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | false | Log every request the server receives |

---

## Time-travel replay with `--at`

Every captured record is timestamped. `--at` lets you replay the capture as it looked at a specific point in time — the server returns the most recent record for each resource whose timestamp is ≤ the given time.

```sh
kshrk open capture.tar.gz --at 2026-04-09T10:30:00Z
```

The timestamp must be in RFC3339 format. Use UTC (`Z`) or include an offset (`+05:30`).

This is useful when you have a long capture (e.g. 1h) and want to compare cluster state before and after an incident.

---

## kubectl compatibility

The mock server is designed to be a drop-in replacement for `kubectl`'s real server. Supported behaviours:

| kubectl feature | Status |
|-----------------|--------|
| `kubectl get <resource>` | ✅ |
| `kubectl get <resource> -n <ns>` | ✅ |
| `kubectl get <resource> -A` | ✅ aggregates across captured namespaces |
| `kubectl get <resource> <name>` | ✅ extracted from parent list |
| `kubectl get -o yaml / -o json` | ✅ |
| `kubectl get -o wide` | ✅ uses captured Table column definitions |
| `kubectl describe` | ✅ |
| `kubectl explain` | ✅ uses captured OpenAPI spec |
| Short names (`po`, `svc`, `deploy`, `pvc`, `pv`, …) | ✅ |
| Label selectors (`-l app=foo`) | ✅ |
| Field selectors (`--field-selector status.phase=Running`) | ✅ |
| Watch (`-w`) | ✅ synthetic event stream |
| Write operations (`apply`, `delete`, `edit`, …) | ❌ read-only |
| `kubectl exec` / `kubectl logs` | ❌ |
| `kubectl top` | ❌ metrics API not captured |

### Resources not in the capture

If you run `kubectl get pvc` but PVCs were not included in the capture config, the server returns an empty list with a `Warning: 299` header rather than an error. kubectl displays:

```
No resources found in default namespace.
Warning: persistentvolumeclaims not found in capture; was it included in the capture config?
```

This is intentional — it avoids confusing `Error from server:` output for resources that simply weren't captured.
